# BITS-Notes

This repository has my notes from my 3rd year, since all classes were held online. 

In the first semester (found in `3-1`), I wrote them in Markdown, and in the second semester (found in `3-2`) I wrote them in LaTeX. The compiled PDFs are also provided, and found in the `output` folder for notes written in LaTeX.

The notes for the Machine Learning course have been merged with the notes for FDS due to the large overlap between the courses.

## Disclaimers

* The information may not be complete or 100% reliable until we have a major exam on that portion.
* Often parts of the syllabus were cut out. You may not find what you are looking for in that case.
* If the portions were covered in previous courses, I will point to that, but not include it.

I welcome any and all pull requests and issues.
